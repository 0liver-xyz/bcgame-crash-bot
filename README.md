## Overview

This repository contains a **demonstration** of an automated BC.Game Crash execution system, developed as a private research and engineering project.

The purpose of this repo is to showcase **system design, execution discipline, and risk-control logic**.

## Key Characteristics

- Rule-based session management
- Configurable execution limits
- Stop conditions and capital protection logic
- Automated monitoring and state control
- Designed to avoid uncontrolled progression behavior

## What This Repo Shows

- Real execution workflow and system behavior
- How automation decisions are gated and controlled
- How risk boundaries are enforced at runtime

Core logic is intentionally withheld.
